### Why
I am student studying computer science who mainly use fedora linux and cli programs and which this playbook sets up as well as my servers which i use to host website,media and backups

The playbook is mostly being developed for personal use, so stuff is going to be constantly changing and breaking.

### Getting started
```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml
```
